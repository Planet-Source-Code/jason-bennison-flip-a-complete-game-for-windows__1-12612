This is a shareware, To upgrade it so everything works, 
Select Validate from the Help Menu and enter "30169862" into 
the inputbox, and enjoy!

If you have been cursing this shareware thing,  then you should have
read this txt file first :-)

If you find this code useful, **please rate it**, afterall over 17500 
people paid either £14.99 or $19.99 for it back in 1996/1997.

I only ask that you dont use this project in its entirety for 
any financial gain without prior permission, you might be able to
get this by contacting me on jasonbennison@hotmail.com, and sharing
your sucess with me.

This was my first ever project in Visual Basic. It was a spare time
thing. Prior to this I was (and still am) a C Programmer, for this reason,
you may notice some unconventional programming methodology as my C++ programming
habits die hard. I was relatively new to Visual Basic when this was made.

in 1998, I did a more advanced version of Flip! in Visual C++, but it's sales
only attained just under 4500, so I didnt continue it. The slump in sales was
probably due to the explosion in new computer game releases following the
success of DirectX/Direct Play, which changed Game programming methodology forever! 
It was described as Visual Basic for Game Programmers.

This version was mainly distributed on Magazine Cover-mounted CD-ROMs as
a shareware, a handful of retailers carried the original disc. Most sales 
were a result of publication on Internet download sites and 
dial-up bulletinboards in the mid/late 1990's

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

In code it demonstrates among other things: 
Animation/graphics, 
How to make your own custom toolbar, 
Music (MCI32), Game timing control, 
Keeping a Score table, 
Mouse control, 
A method of employing Shareware,

Programmed in VB4 32bit, it will compile in VB6.

Apologies for not formatting it or commenting it correctly, In the early days
of programming, we werent allowed these luxuries. There were enourmous limits
imposed when you get used with working with just 1K and 16K or RAM. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------


I have released it to the Programmers domain so others can learn Windows game 
programming from it. Furthermore, I chose Planet Source Code, primarily because
other programmers material obtained from there has helped extensively in 
my previous commercial and my own C++ and VB development projects.
